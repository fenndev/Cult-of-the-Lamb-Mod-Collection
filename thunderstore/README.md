# Cult of QoL - A Collection

* Removes intros.
* Cheese the fishing mini-game. (No need to press anything apart from the initial cast).
* Remove extra buttons from menus (Discord, bug report, Twitch etc.)
* Collect tithes/inspire all at once. Inspire has some quirks I'm working on (the main one being when a follower levels up(?), it comes from the follower you initiated the conversation with, not the follower that's levelling up.)
* Reverse the damage change to the golden fleece introduced in 1.0.13.
* Double the rate the damage increases with the golden fleece.
* Halves (where possible) the cost of refining goods. Gets rounded up. i.e. something that costs 3 originally ends up being 2. Something that costs 10, becomes 5.
* Cure illness/exhaustion when a follower gains loyalty (the floaty white eyes thing).
* If you have multiple outhouses, followers should now go to the "less full" one more often than not.
* Unlock pre-order DLC and Twitch items (Plushie building, drops)
* You can now collect tithe from the oldies again. Brutal.

Each mod can be enabled/disabled individually from within the config.

## Changelog

### 1.4.0

* Made some adjustments to the outhouse stuff, see how it goes. Still a WIP.
* Added game speed manipulation. Left/Right arrows to increase/decrease in 0.25 increments. Up arrow resets it to default. Maximum (artifical cap) is 5, and good luck to you playing it at that speed.
* Improved the elderly extortion patch. Should now grey out when they've already been extorted, and only appear once you've unlocked that doctrine.

### 1.3.1

* Fixed the Twitch patches causing the game to lock you onto the portal platform, thingy.
* Modified golden fleece patch to be inline with changes from 1.0.13.

### 1.3

* Added ability to unlock Twitch items (will unlock on game load)
* Added being able to collect tithe from the oldies. Brutal.
* Added lumber/stone mine immortality.
* Added being able to extort the elderly. Brutal.

### 1.2

* Inspire all is somewhat fixed. Instead of being stuck sometimes, they'll move on to their next task.
* Added option to cure illness/exhaustion when a follower gains loyalty (the floaty white eyes thing).
