# Rebirth

* Followers can be reborn, allowing you to change their names, looks etc.
* First one is free; subsequent ones on the same follower require 25 Rebirth Tokens obtained from crusading. 
* * Source of the tokens is from killing enemies, destroying old bone piles (not the ones from enemies), and dungeon chests.
* * The drop chance starts at 15% and scales with your dungeon luck modifier. 
* The followers' XP carries over, but there is a 10% chance they lose half of their XP when reborn. There is a notification when this happens.
* Their old body stays; compost it, eat it. Up to you.

## Installation

* Install [BepInExPack CultOfTheLamb](https://cult-of-the-lamb.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_CultOfTheLamb/)
* Install [COTL API](https://cult-of-the-lamb.thunderstore.io/package/xhayper/COTL_API/)
* Extract the contents of Rebirth & COTL API into your BepInEx folder "...\Cult of the Lamb\BepInEx\" folder.

If done correctly, you should have a Rebirth folder inside your plugins folder alongside the API DLL and its Assets folder.
