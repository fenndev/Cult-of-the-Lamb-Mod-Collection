# Rebirth

* Followers can be reborn, allowing you to change their names, looks etc.
* First one is free, subsequent ones on the same follower require 25 Rebirth Tokens, which are obtained from crusading. 20% chance to drop 1-3 on an enemies death.
* The followers XP carries over, but there is 10% chance they lose half of their XP when being reborn. There is a notification when this happens.
* Their old body stays, compost it, eat it. Up to you.
